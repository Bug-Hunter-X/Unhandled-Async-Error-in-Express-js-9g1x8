# Unhandled Asynchronous Error in Node.js Express.js Application

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js Express.js applications: improper handling of asynchronous operations that might fail.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` presents the corrected version with robust error handling.

The issue arises when an asynchronous function (`getData` in this case) encounters an error. Without proper error handling, the Express.js server might crash, or the client might receive an incomplete or unexpected response.

The solution involves using try...catch blocks or callback functions with error handling to gracefully manage potential errors during asynchronous operations.
